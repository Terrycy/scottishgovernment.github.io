Mygov.scot is a place currently under development where people in Scotland will be able to go to access online public services no matter which organisation or public sector website provides them. Our approach is to work closely and in partnership with public sector organisations to put user needs at the forefront of service delivery and design.

Initially mygov.scot will have a representative selection of content from the Justice Directorate with a focus on housing services for citizens e.g. legal rights for tenants and landlords.

Who is developing mygov.scot?

The Scottish Government Digital Directorate is responsible for the digital strategy for Scotland. We are the Online Services division within the Digital Directorate and we are responsible for delivering mygov.scot and supporting a wider programme of service transformation. We will be working across central government, local government and health to deliver this new public sector service.

Why are we developing mygov.scot?

We want to develop mygov.scot as a place where you can find any public service you need even if you don’t know which organisation supplies that service. Mygov.scot will use powerful search technology to help you find what you need.

We also want to create an online place that you’d rather use than queuing or calling because it’s simple, quick and you can do what you need to do when you want to do it whether that’s by using your smart phone, tablet, laptop or desk top computer.

Is this all about saving money?

Of course we want to make savings – according to UK Government studies, the potential cost savings, UK-wide, from digital delivery is estimated to be £1.8 billion a year for central government services alone.

But that is only part of the story. The development of mygov.scot and the wider transformation programme is about putting your needs at the heart of services – what services would you prefer to do online? Can we make life and work in Scotland easier by making day to day tasks more accessible?

What services will be available via mygov.scot?

As it develops, mygov.scot will provide access to all services – information and transactions.

To achieve this, we must work working closely with our partners and our programme of engagement and transformation will support this.

Mygov.scot will not include detailed guidance or corporate information – this type of information will remain available via other sources.

How are you going to develop mygov.scot?

Mygov.scot will be developed primarily using the principles of ‘Scrum’ agile development which involve a series of releases – alpha, beta, launch which are then tested and released and continually refined in response to user feedback.

Next steps

When will we see an early version of mygov.scot?

An early ‘alpha’ version was posted to our Scottish Public Sector Stakeholders in July/August.

A further version is expected later in 2014 but this will be based on a re-iteration of earlier releases. The mygov.scot philosophy is to create, re-iterate and release with your feedback at the heart of this.

We’ll be keeping you up to date with what we’re doing by posting regular updates here so favourite us and keep coming back.

I’m currently developing a new online service – who should I speak to?
